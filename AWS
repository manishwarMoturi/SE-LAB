Step 1: Login to AWS /canvas account
Step 2: Services --  EC2
Step 3: Choose region which is near ?  
	Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance 
	Stage 1  --Name (Giving name to the machine) ubuntu
	Stage 2  -- Select AMI  ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) ubuntu server
	Stage 3   --  Architecture as 64-bit	  
	Stage 4  --  Instance type ----  t2.micro(default 1 CPU,1 GB RAM)
	Stage 5  --  Create a new keypair---a keypair will downloaded  with extension .pem
                              Store key in folder AWS
	Stage 6  -- Network Setting ----Create Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
Do this step : HERE select http and https
   Stage 7 -- Storage - 8GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)
         Stage 8 --- click on launch instance
    Stage 9: Number of instances ---1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Observation - One machines created
Do this step:---once it is created select that instance and click on connect
Here copy the ssh – i command from SSH client connect tab
We can use powershell /gitbash /webconsole , to connect to ubuntu machine.
NOTE:- cd path of AWS folder // change path
To connect to above terminals we need to go into the path of the keypair.and 
paste  the
 ssh -i command from the aws console
Step 1:-  Run the following commands to install s/w
sudo apt update
2.	Install docker by command
sudo apt-get install docker.io
3.	Install git by command
sudo apt install git
4.	Install nano( text editor) by command
Sudo apt install nano
step 2:-  git clone <paste the github link of maven-web-java project>
step 3:- navigate to the maven-web-java project
Step 4:-  nano Dockerfile 
  #Use an official Java runtime as a parent image
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11

#Copy the built WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory COPY**/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/

#Expose the port Tomcat is running on

#EXPOSE 8080

#Start Tomcat server

#CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

Step 1:- build your image 
	docker build –t <imagename> .(dot)
Step 2:- check for images
Step 3:- run image
	docker  run –d  --name app-demo –p 6060:8080 <image name>
Step:-4 Accessing the app by public ip of virtual machine

dockerfile for deploying index.html from your computer not by maven:
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

sudo docker build –t mywebapp .
sudo docker run –d –p 80:80 mywebapp
Go to instances and click on instance here
:  Copy public ipv4 address
