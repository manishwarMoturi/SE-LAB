Setting Up  Jenkins CI------using GitHub Webhook with Jenkins 

Step 1: Configure Webhook in GitHub
1.	Go to your GitHub repository.
2.	Navigate to Settings → Webhooks.
3.	Click “Add webhook”.
4.	In the Payload URL field:
o	Enter the Jenkins webhook URL in the format:
http://<jenkins-server-url>/github-webhook/
Note: If Jenkins is running on localhost, GitHub cannot access it directly.
Use ngrok to expose your local Jenkins to the internet:

o	ngrok.exe http <Jenkins local host:8080>
	Use the generated ngrok URL, e.g.:
	https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev /github-webhook/
5.	Set Content type to:
application/json
6.	Under “Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?”, select:
o	 Just the push event
7.	Click “Add webhook” to save.

 Step 2: Configure Jenkins to Accept GitHub Webhooks
1.	Open Jenkins Dashboard.
2.	Select the job (freestyle or pipeline) you’ve already created.
3.	Click Configure.
4.	Scroll down to the Build Triggers section.
5.	Check the box: ✅GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
6.	Click Save.
________________________________________
 Step 3: Test the Setup
1.	Make any code update in your local repo and push it to GitHub.
2.	Once pushed, GitHub will trigger the webhook.
3.	Jenkins will automatically detect the change and start the build pipeline.
________________________________________
outcome
•	You’ve successfully connected GitHub and Jenkins using webhooks.
•	Every time you push code to GitHub, Jenkins will automatically start building your project without manual intervention.

Set-uping the ngrok

How to Install and Use ngrok

Step 1. Download ngrok
https://ngrok.com/download
Download and extract it for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Step 2. Connect Your ngrok Account (optional but useful)
After you sign up (free), ngrok gives you an auth token.
•	Then got to  Your Authtoken  click here and copy
•	Go ngrok 	command promt
CREATE AUTHENTICATOR [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken]
Run this command (replace <your_token> with yours):
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
This ensures stable sessions and more control.

Step 3. Start a Tunnel for Jenkins

Assuming Jenkins runs locally on port 8080:
Now Go ngrok 	command prompt and type below commad
ngrok http 8080
You’ll see output like:

Session Status                online
Forwarding                   https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080
Copy the HTTPS URL (https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev) — this is your public Jenkins URL for webhooks.
Step 4. Use it in GitHub Webhook

In your GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks:
•	Payload URL: 		 [paste the url generated by ngrok]

https://wintry-gloryingly-nam.ngrok-free.dev /github-webhook/    [please include this – remaining all default]
Now, whenever you push code, GitHub sends an event to that URL, which ngrok forwards to your local Jenkins.
